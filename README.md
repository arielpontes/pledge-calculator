# Pledge calculator

A pledge calculator that works in exactly the same way as the one on [thelifeyoucansave.org](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge/), except that it converts the income provided into [international dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_dollar) before calculating the pledge in order to correct for the distortion caused by the fact that different countries have very different costs of living. If you make 80,000.00 RON per year in Romania, for example, that's only 19,790.74 USD, meaning your recommended donation is 0%. However, the standard of living of a person who makes 80,000.00 RON per year in Romania is much more similar to a person who makes 42,144.97 USD per year in the United States, meaning they could easily afford donating 1% of their income.
