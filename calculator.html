                            This pledge calculator works in exactly the same way
                            as the one on <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge/">
                                thelifeyoucansave.org
                            </a>. The only difference is that it converts the
                            income provided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_dollar">
                                international dollars
                            </a> before calculating the pledge in order to
                            correct for the distortion caused by the fact that
                            different countries have very different costs of
                            living. If you make 80,000.00 RON per year in Romania,
                            for example, that's only 19,790.74 USD, meaning your
                            recommended donation is 0%. However, the standard of
                            living of a person who makes 80,000.00 RON per year
                            in Romania is much more similar to a person who makes
                            42,144.97 USD per year in the United States, meaning
                            they could easily afford donating 1% of their income.

                            The calculator uses data from the <a
                                href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP">
                                World Bank</a>. For each country, I use the most
                            recent value available between 2017 and 2019.
                            Countries with no data for this period are not
                            included in the list. Currency codes are taken from
                            <a href="https://datahub.io/core/country-codes">
                                here</a>.

                            The original calculator is based on the "Giving Scale"
                            provided by Peter Singer in the book The Life You
                            Can Save, which recommends different donations
                            depending on your income bracket. The Giving Scale
                            looks as follows:
